Thinking: This seems like a fun project to help with?
  Then I'd really appreciate it.
  I'm looking for software developers and animators. People who also share the goal of creating the best OS for primary schools. 
  Any help is welcome! Because together we can make this project a reality. 
  I thank everyone in advance for their help.
Anyone who wants to contribute to this project can join the Discord.
  The Discord section details how you can help us, and also explains in detail what the project is and what it entails.
