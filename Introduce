Hi! My name is Sem. I'm a boy from holland who has a dream. 
That dream is to build a linux distro, Not just a linux distro but a distro for primary schools,
I feel like that nowadays operating systems like windows and ChromeOS dont really care about the people. 
We all know that windows is one big AD and chromeOS has a problem with privacy. 
So its all not Ideal for primary schools to use those OS. 
I'm 17 years old, and if I'm being completely honest,
I don't know much about Linux.
But I do have an idea. And I know that with your help, I can eventually make LumaOS a reality.
So that the reason that i want to build LumaOS.
LumaOS is an Ubuntu-based operating system for primary schools.
What makes LumaOS special, and why choose LumaOS?
LumaOS is an operating system designed for primary schools.
Our OS is user-friendly for children aged 4 to 12 and provides a safe environment for the school.
Our OS also offers unique and helpful features never before seen in an OS.
For example, LumaOS includes a teacher dashboard app that gives teachers complete control over their classroom.
Within the app, they can choose what each student is allowed to do.
Other features include student monitoring, blocking certain apps,
and force-opening certain apps for students. With LumaOS, we provide the ultimate experience for both students and teachers.
but only with your help can we make this come true.
